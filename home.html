		<h1 >Samar Abdulaziz</h1>
		<p>Hello and welcom on my website</p><br>

		<p>Short Story about Adventure</p>
		<p> <span> O</span> nce upon a time there were three friends named Ali, Hamza and Sara. 
			They were very close friends.<br> They lived in a backward area called Palawan .<br> 
			But they were very happy with their lives. <br>
			Everyday they used to play in the street from 6 o’clock to 7 o’clock 
		</p>
<p>In Palawan near their house was a giant house which was named as “Temple of death” by the people. <br>
        Because for long no body lived in their but each night came the voices of laughter and talks <br>
        which horrified the people of Palawan and people thought it was the voice of ghosts <br>
        so nobody dared to go in. 
        One day while the three of them were playing in the street<br>
       their ball went in to that house. 
        Ali said come and fetch the ball and play again but Sania<br> was much scared so she said I won’t go.
			</p>
